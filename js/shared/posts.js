            `Gamers struggling to maintain a steady framerate in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR after installing one too many graphics mods have reason to rejoice, as a new mod for the game adds support for temporal upscaling and promises to dramatically improve performance. While being able to explore the world of Bethesda Game Studio’s Skyrim in VR has made the game a hit with many players, poor performance on all but the most powerful PCs has kept the game out of reach of many gamers.`,
            `Released for PlayStation VR and PC in 2017 and 2018 respectively, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR takes the addictive, open-world gameplay of the 2011 original and transfers it to VR. Although gamers were eager to explore the mountainous province of Skyrim in this new, immersive mode, poor performance and unoptimized controls left many players disappointed with the VR ports. Much as happened with the original game, however, a community of talented creators has produced numerous mods for Skyrim VR over the years that have addressed many player complaints.`,
            `In a new tweet from the Flat2VR account on Twitter, which covers mods for both VR and flatscreen-native games, it was announced that modder PureDark has added support for DLSS 2, FSR2, and XeSS support to Skyrim VR. By using temporal upscaling, this new mod can drastically improve the game’s performance for PC players regardless of which brand of video card they use. This Skyrim VR mod has the potential to make the demanding title playable for gamers on older hardware, as well as give gamers on high-end PCs the ability to go all-out with graphics mods without the worry of tanking their framerate.`,
            `In a video linked in a follow-up tweet, Skyrim VR YouTuber Cangar showed the mod in action and provided gamers with a walkthrough on how to use it. Standing near the game’s starting area, Cangar goes through the process of enabling the mod before toggling DLSS on and off to show the difference in performance and visual quality. While the game struggles to go above 70fps at Ultra settings with the mod turned off, enabling it allows Cangar to maintain a near-90fps framerate while also improving the antialiasing and overall visual quality.`,
            `For gamers who have been holding off from diving into the world of Skyrim VR due to fear of poor PC performance, this new mod could be the perfect reason to finally give the open-world VR title a go. And if wandering through the frozen wastes of the game’s mountainous setting proves to be too exhausting, players can always kick back on their bed and see if they can beat Skyrim VR laying down.`,

            `If you came to Skyrim via some of the older Elder Scrolls games, you were probably used to being able to see your character when you opened the inventory screen. It let you know what you'd look like as you tried out each new piece of equipment (a mismatched dweeb), and if you were one of those strict first-person-only players it was one of the few times you got to see your outfit.`,
            `While a mod for vanilla Skyrim called Oblivion Style Inventory Character View(opens in new tab) offered the chance to gawp at yourself in each new set of armor you looted from dead bandits, a bug would sometimes leave the camera stuck that way. Now, an updated version that's compatible with Skyrim Special Edition and Anniversary Edition called Show Player in Menus(opens in new tab) is out, and after a quick test on a couple of saves seems to be working just fine.`,
            `There are various options that can be tweaked, including one to turn off the camera movement during combat if you open your inventory to choke down a potion and three grilled leeks. If you still want to see any armor piece you select floating in the air that's an option too. Plus, while inspecting yourself like a dress-up doll, you can spin the player model on the spot with a right-click of the mouse or the right-stick on a gamepad.`,
            `Show Player in Menus is compatible with any UI replacement mod you may have, as well as several other mods that mess with the perspective like SmoothCam(opens in new tab), Customizable Camera(opens in new tab), ImprovedCameraSE(opens in new tab), and more drastic overhauls like True Directional Movement – Modernized Third Person Gameplay(opens in new tab) and Skyrim Souls RE(opens in new tab).`,
            `There's a little bit of homework to get it running if you don't already have the full suite of mods that help other mods installed. You'll first have to make sure you've got SKSE(opens in new tab), Address Library for SKSE Plugins(opens in new tab), and MCM Helper(opens in new tab) installed, as well as our favorite interface replacer SkyUI(opens in new tab). Then download Show Player in Menus from Nexus Mods(opens in new tab).`,
            `Our list of the best Skyrim Special Edition mods includes plenty of other recommendations if you're looking for quality-of-life improvements. And if you're a Skyrim VR player who wants to enjoy this as a discombobulating out-of-body experience, try an alternative called View Yourself VR(opens in new tab).`

            `Video Games and TV shows go hand in hand, they are not just a means of brand promotion but also provide an in-universe experience to the players. Game of Thrones and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim go way back, the latter being a game set in a medieval world, often getting regular tweaks that resemble the widely-loved show. Ever since its release back in 2011, Game of Thrones mods have been popping up over time, with some popular ones adding things like Valyrian Steel weapons, Stark companions, and the Game of Thrones music. The most recent one added the prequel House of The Dragon’s famous dragons into the world of Elder Scrolls.`,
            `The full list of dragons featured in the mod includes Caraxes, the Bloodwyrm, Dreamfyre, Seasmoke, and Balerion, the Black Dread. This is the newest mod and an expansion on a previous one released last month that added skins for Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion.`,
            `The new mods add a couple of new aspects to dragon combat in Skyrim, which can get too repetitive after playing the game for 12 years. Not only do the dragons look different, but they also get new movement patterns and sound effects that make them feel more realistic than ever.`,

            `Bethesda fans believe they've found evidence indicating that The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim could be receiving a premium marketplace for mods and third-party DLC in an upcoming update. Skyrim has thrived since its release in 2011 in no small part due to robust post-launch mod support. Modders have added regions full of new adventures and gameplay to Skyrim, at no extra cost. The possibility of monetizing Skyrim mods is unlikely to be popular, but it's something Bethesda has done before.`,
            `Between April 24 and 27 in 2015, Bethesda launched a Skyrim Steam Workshop feature for paid mods or "Purchasable Modifications," allowing The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim players to pay what they want for certain mods. Profits were split between Bethesda, Valve, and mod creators. Backlash was so significant that Bethesda not only killed the feature in days, but refunded all payments to those who chose to purchase any premium mods. The 2017 Skyrim Anniversary Edition Creation Club, offering a similar concept, was more successful but hasn't been supported with new content for years.`,
            `Bethesda fans watching for news regarding Starfield recently noticed a Steam database update for multiple versions of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim dubbed with the label, "Marketplace." This isn't an update for the live version of Skyrim, but rather a non-public branch likely being used for testing. The branch has since receive several small updates since it first arrived on Steam on November 16, indicating it's in active development. It appears to be a possible Skyrim update of some kind, though there's no official confirmation of that.`

        title: 'Skyrim Draugr Kills Itself By Running Into Dungeon Trap',

            `A fan of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim witnesses a Draugr killing itself by hilariously running into a dungeon trap. Gamers will face off against a wide variety of enemies in their playthrough of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, including opponents from one of the many races of The Elder Scrolls franchise as well as the different types of creatures and monsters that inhabit these lands.`,
            `Users will run into different types of Draugr, such as the Overlord or Wight, in the dungeons and tombs that are scattered all around the world. They are a fairly common enemy, so players will often battle several Draugr during a particular level or quest in Skyrim. Now, one player witnesses a Draugr kill itself by running into a trap.`,
            `A Reddit user named SelectionRecent5699 has shared a funny video of them encountering a Draugr in a Skyrim dungeon. The user starts attacking the enemy, but the Draugr doesn’t seem interested in fighting and ends up running away, before stepping on a pressure plate and hilariously triggering the massive spike trap that launches it back toward the player. However, SelectionRecent5699 is not out of danger as some Draugr enemies spawn in the same area before the video ends.`,
            `Some users talk about how the Draugr simply wanted to go back to sleep, and how Skyrim players kept disturbing their rest. One fan compares it to how followers in Skyrim keep running into similar situations while exploring dungeons, with some of them getting stuck in a loop of constantly triggering traps. A few users also mention the funny running animations of the Draugr as it steps on the pressure plate.`,
            `One fan believes it to be a scripted event, as it offers a great opportunity for developers to introduce players to dungeons traps. However, another user mentions that the actual scripted events take place when Arvel the Swift runs into a trap in Skyrim after stealing an antique golden claw. Nevertheless, this incident seems to be a common occurrence as several fans mention witnessing a similar accident while exploring the many dungeons of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.`,
            `Gamers will run into all sorts of traps in the game, and some have started using them to intentionally kill enemies in the area. As an example, one Skyrim player showed a neat tactic in which they tricked enemies into triggering pressure plates and getting hit with a similar spiked trap.`
